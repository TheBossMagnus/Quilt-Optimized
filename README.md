# Quilt Optimized

[![Modrinth](https://img.shields.io/modrinth/dt/quilt-optimized?color=1bd96a&label=Modrinth&style=for-the-badge)](https://modrinth.com/modpack/quilt-optimized/versions)

This modpack is designed to optimize and enhance your Minecraft experience with the Quilt Loader. It features a performance-focused version and a version with additional quality-of-life mods(SOON). Everything is currently in beta.

## Installation

I recommend [ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com), but you can use any launcher with support for Modrinth modpack(MultiMC, Prism, GDLauncher, ...)
For ATLauncher:

- Go to **packs**
- Select **Modrinth** tab from the left
- **Search for Quilt Optimized** using the search bar
- Click on **new instance**
- Press **Install** in the pop-up, then press **ok**
- go to instances and click **play** on Quit Optimized
